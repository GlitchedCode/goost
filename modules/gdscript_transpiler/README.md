# GDScript Transpiler

This is a very early and experimental implementation of general-purpose
GDScript-to-X language transpiler which aims to generate sources which could be
natively understood by other compilers.

Currently implements GDScript to C++ transpiler.

This module is highly unstable and should not be used for anything but
educational purposes. Pull requests are welcome that aim to improve the module.
