# Modules

This directory may contain both builtin and community modules. Builtin modules
are officially maintained by the Goost authors and are versioned as part of the
extension. On the contrary, community modules represent `git` submodules which
are maintained by third-party developers, so those may not be actively
maintained.

For further instructions, see Goost documentation:
