# Tests

Goost uses [Gut](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) to run tests.

## Gut
- Upstream: https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/
- Version: v7.1.0 (git: 5627110d9970c20949c1281a937e89d532f55341)
- License: MIT

## Usage

After build, run the following command from within Goost root directory:

```
python run.py tests
```

If you'd like to write new tests or update existing ones, you can run the editor
instead which opens the test project for you:

```
python run.py editor
```

Running the Godot editor to write tests is not required, you can still use your
favorite code editor and just run the tests alone via command-line interface.
