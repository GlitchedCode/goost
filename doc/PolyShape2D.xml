	<brief_description>
		The base class for implementing decomposition or mesh-based classes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Takes outlines from [PolyNode2D] added as children of this node and decomposes them into shapes determined by [member build_mode].
		This class is used as a base for classes such as [PolyCollisionShape2D] and other related mesh-based objects in 2D.
