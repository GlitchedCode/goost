		Draws any [Shape2D] resource. Useful for quick prototyping.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is a node with the entire purpose of rendering [Shape2D] resources just like drawing collision shapes in the editor, yet it's also possible to override the color per each node rather than globally with this class. While the class supports all existing shapes, it's currently not convenient to edit polygon-based shapes, so use [Polygon2D] node which is much more superior for editing and drawing of polygons (with textures).
